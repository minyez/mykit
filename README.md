# mykit

Personal toolkit for manuplating input and output files of various electornic structure calculators for periodic systems.

*Note: Under extensive refactoring. Limited functionality and faaaaaar from the objectives.*

## Objectives

<!-- *This python module has no intention, and is definitely unable to compete with the repsected [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) module.*-->

This module has its emphasis on the input files generation and tutorial purpose, by which means

- The writing of daily-use input files is faster, by implemented easy-to-use classes for the inputs, equipped with many convenient factory methods.
- Generate all inputs for a tutorial calculation with one command-line, with tags explained within as comments (if possible)
<!-- - A series of calculations can be run by statements within a python script, as in [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/). And it also provides an 
    alternative to run in a bash script, with each command line a self-explained -->
- Conversion from input files of one atomic simulation program to those (or that) of another is nothing else than one-line command in terminal.
